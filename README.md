In this project, we deal with one type of nonlinear dimensionality reduction method which was originally introduced by Coifman and lafon in 2004-2006. We will apply the new method to real biological data and compare its performance to that of principle component analysis (PCA), which is a classic example of linear dimensionality reduction method.
